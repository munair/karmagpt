#Welcome to Karma GPT!

This [GPT model](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-OVHGBfj0E-karma-gpt) is the AI-guru explaining the workings of karma, drawing exclusively from "The Workings of Kamma" by Pa Auk Sayadaw and the [Suttapiṭaka](https://suttacentral.net/pitaka/sutta) of the Pāḷi cannon. (Yes, we know it's 'kamma' but let's stick with 'karma' for simplicity.)

Remember: Karma's got you covered, and so does Karma GPT!
